# AI Chatbot Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and configure the open-source AI chatbot on your Amazing Grace Church website.

## üìã Overview

The AI chatbot appears on all pages as a floating button in the bottom-right corner. It can answer frequently asked questions about:
- Service times
- How to join ministries (band, etc.)
- Church location and contact information
- Events and activities
- Sermons
- Giving and donations
- And more!

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Option 1: Hugging Face Inference API (Recommended - Free Tier Available)

1. **Create a Hugging Face Account**
   - Go to [https://huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co)
   - Sign up for a free account

2. **Get Your API Key**
   - Go to Settings > Access Tokens
   - Create a new token with "Read" permissions
   - Copy the token

3. **Add to Environment Variables**
   ```env
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   HUGGINGFACE_API_URL="https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models"
   AI_MODEL="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2"
   ```

4. **Free Models Available**
   - `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2` (Recommended)
   - `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`
   - `google/flan-t5-large` (Lightweight)

### Option 2: Ollama (Local Deployment - No API Key Needed)

1. **Install Ollama**
   - Download from [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
   - Install on your server or local machine

2. **Pull a Model**
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2
   # or
   ollama pull mistral
   ```

3. **Update API Route**
   - Modify `src/app/api/ai/chat/route.ts`
   - Uncomment the Ollama section
   - Update `OLLAMA_API_URL` if needed

4. **Add Environment Variables**
   ```env
   OLLAMA_API_URL="http://localhost:11434/api/generate"
   OLLAMA_MODEL="llama3.2"
   ```

### Option 3: No API Key (Fallback Mode)

The chatbot will work without an API key using rule-based responses. It will answer common questions using the knowledge base, but responses will be simpler.

## üí° Tips

### For Better Responses
1. Keep the knowledge base updated with current information
2. Use specific, clear questions
3. The chatbot learns from conversation history

### Performance
- Hugging Face free tier has rate limits
- Ollama runs locally (no limits, but requires server resources)
- Fallback mode works without API (simpler responses)

### Privacy
- Conversations are not stored in the database
- No personal data is collected
- All processing happens server-side

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Chatbot Not Appearing
- Check that `AIChatbot` is imported in `layout.tsx`
- Verify no JavaScript errors in console
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured

### API Errors
- Verify API key is correct
- Check Hugging Face model is available
- For Ollama, ensure it's running locally
- Check server logs for detailed errors

### Poor Responses
- Update the knowledge base with more information
- Try a different AI model
- Check that the prompt is correctly formatted

## üîí Security

- API keys are stored server-side only
- No user data is stored
- Rate limiting recommended for production
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
